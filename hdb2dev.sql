Remember that if the hit gets messy we will send a cleaner and deduct the money from your account.\n\nYour mission in Hong Kong will be fairly complicated. The ultimate target is a triad leader named Lee Hong. He is too well guarded and even if you succeeded in eliminating him, chances are that you would not get out of Hong Kong alive. The agency has prepared a plan that will make Lee Hong lose his influence outside his mansion.\n\nWe will get back to you when you have completed your first mission.',1),(3,'Ambush at the Wang Fou Restaurant',3,'Congratulations. The hit in Chiu Dai Park worked as planned.\n\nThe Blue Lotus Triad are terrified that Lee Hong is blaming them for the killing of his negotiator. They fear a war between the triads.\n\nWe have received information that the Blue Lotus Triad will send an emissary to the Lee Hong\'s restaurant to apologize. An assassination of the emissary and his bodyguards will look like a counter hit from Lee Hong.',1),(4,'The Massacre at Cheung Chau Fish Restaurant',4,'The hit on the Blue Lotus Triad has triggered a full-scale war between the triads. The district police chief, being on both triad\'s payroll, is quite concerned with the current predicament.\n\nA truce meeting between the two triads has been arranged by the police chief. The meeting takes place on neutral ground in a small Chinese fish restaurant. If this mission is success, Lee Hong will be within your grasp.',1),(5,'The Lee Hong Assassination',5,'Good job.\n\nThe plan is working. The police have withdrawn their protection of Lee Hong, and many of his connections are scared. Lee Hong is now accessible, but it still remains quite a challenge - Hong has a small army to protect him.\n\nThis mission will be very complex. Take your time and and explore the location before committing to action. Best wishes.',1),(6,'Find the U\'wa Tribe',6,'Welcome to Colombia.\n\nYour next target is the Colombian Drug Lord, Pablo Belisario Ochoa. Our customer wants to terminate his command.\n\nThe exact location of Pablo\'s camp is unknown, but you will be inserted into an area that should be close. The area is patrolled by Pablo\'s army, so avoid contact unless you are sure you can terminate without alarming the camp.\n\nPablo uses artifacts as a cover for his drug transportation. We know that one of his planes crashed a few days ago. On board the plane was a stolen religious idol. Returning this idol to the local tribe might endear you with them. We would be surprised if they did not know an alternate route to the Pablo\'s camp.',1),(7,'The Jungle God',7,'The Indian tribe knows a secret passage to Pablo\'s camp. It is a small hidden tunnel through the mountains. The passage is guarded by what the Indians call \"Tezcatlipoca\", the god of death. We have a video that proves that this \"god\" is merely a very large jaguar. But that does not make it any less dangerous.',1),(8,'Say Hello to My Little Friend',8,'The camp is now just a few feet away from you. Be careful. It is very well guarded.

The Austrian terrorist, Frantz Fuchs, is planning to blow up the hotel. If successful, it will change the world forever.\n\nFrantz Fuchs is your target. Normally we would not care about the leaders, but preventing the attack will make us popular with many governments and could mean a new clientele for our business.\n\nOur customer has requested the bomb, so you have to take it out of the hotel.',1),(10,'Gunrunner\'s Paradise',10,'Welcome to Rotterdam.\n\nYour next target is the man who supplied Lee Hong and Pablo with weapons, the notorious gunrunner Arkadij Jegorov, aka Boris.\n\nBoris is hiding on his ship somewhere in the harbor of Rotterdam, but we do not know the exact location. We have information that a local Dutch Gang has arranged to purchase some of Boris\'s merchandise. By tracking them, we might be able to locate the ship.\n\nOur intelligence department has stumbled across a weird fact that you should know. It seems that Lee Hong, Boris, Frantz Fuchs, and Pablo all served in the French Legion together. If that is a coincidence, it is one weird coincidence...',1),(11,'Plutonium Runs Loose',11,'Well done.

The model is old so you should be able to disarm it if necessary.',1),(12,'The Setup',12,'The Agency is in turmoil.\n\nOur intelligence department is working on a theory that the customers for your last four hits are actually just one person! As I wrote you earlier we normally won\'t take part of larger wars. But it turns out that this one customer is very powerful. So powerful that the board of directors has accepted another mission from him.\n\nThis was done under the condition that it was the last contract and that another of our agents did the job. The customer accepted the first condition, but refused the second - and the board gave in on that. The customer only wants you! That is understandable considering your track record, but it reeks.\n\nThe next mission is very simple so do me a favor - stay cool no matter what happens!',1),(13,'Meet Your Brother',13,'\"The return of the prodigal son - now this calls for a celebration!

I should have known you would rebel against your old man - not at all like No. 48. Now there is a loyal and trusting clone. Man was made at the end of the week\'s work, when God was tired. I greatly improved on all of the built-in flaws. I\'ll prove to the whole world who\'s right - and decide who will be left! A little play on words, my boy - I know you like that sort of thing.\n\nSon - I hope you know that this will hurt me more than you. The effort to make you! Every little manipulated gene! Oh you were so pampered! You are the apotheosis of Man! When I created you, I was standing on the shoulders of midgets. But I ironed out all the wrinkles - and still you turn on me! I discovered the true power of 47 chromosomes. Do you think that was easy? As always, I was ahead of my time. They shook their bony little heads, looked at me with their beady little eyes and said I was crazy. You, my friend, and living proof I\'m not!\n\nI know you want me dead, my boy, and I forgive you! But let me tell you - dying is the last thing I plan to do!

Security is not exactly lax - plenty of guards roaming the mansion compound. However, don\'t expect to free Vittorio just like that.\n\nThe Don is running a tight ship, and if alarmed he will probably kill the hostage and escape. They are used to people coming to pay respect, ransoms or bribes - but they are alerted by unusual activities, check out the map we have of the grounds.\n\nBuena Fortuna, 47!',2),(15,'St. Petersburg Stakeout',2,'47 - Diana here. Sorry that you had so little luck at the mansion. It\'s really hard to tell where Vittorio was taken. We lost track of him at the airport. \n\nThe Agency does, however, feel that we fulfilled our end of the deal, and expect you to comply with the terms by completing a minor assignment at St. Petersburg. \n\nYour objective is to take out an ex-KGB officer, participating in a secret meeting, solely arranged so that you can take a clean shot at this officer. \nThe meeting is taking place at 1300 hours today in the Pushkin Building on Varosnij Square. The room is on the 2nd floor in the west wing, overlooking the square. The windows are marked on the attached image. \n\nThe building is the former FSB headquarters, and can only be accessed from the square. There\'s one main entrance and a back entrance - both heavily guarded by FSB paramilitary personnel. \n\nThe target must be eliminated during the meeting, which is scheduled to last 5 minutes. \n\nAbsolutely nobody in the meeting room except the target must be harmed. This is very important, 47. \n\nUpon arrival by metro you will find your equipment paraphernalia in locker # 137 at the station. Your escape route is returning with the train.\n\nAvoid all contact with soldiers and guards. They are instructed to remove any civilians from the area.

You are required to return to St. Petersburg. \n\nIt seems that your previous assassination really scared the remaining generals. \n\nThey have all begun their own investigations into what happened. Our client is pretty unhappy about this. We need to stop these generals fast. \n\nWe\'ve received information that one of them - General Makarov - is to meet a local mafia boss to buy some protection and hopefully info on who could have carried out the hit. \n\nThey have a preferred meeting point in Kirov Park - nice, secluded and out in the open. We\'ve got some old spy footage of them meeting previously for your reference. \n\nOur intelligence says they are scheduled to meet in Kirov Park at 1400 hrs today, local time - check out your map. \n\nThey will both be arriving in armoured Zil-115 limos, but in separate motorcades.

Brilliant! \n\nOur client is most satisfied, but is still in a hurry to stop the last two generals before they get close to the truth. \n\nWe\'ve received information that one of the generals, general Mikhail Bardachenko, is interrogating people in the basement of the military facilities just off Nevsky Prospekt. \n\nThe video was recorded by a security cam almost two days ago, so we have to hurry. \n\nSomewhere in the multilevel maze of corridors you will find your target - make sure the prisoner being interrogated escapes unscathed. \n\nYour equipment is in the supply yard near a crate marked \"FCK\" just behind the main entrance. \n\nSecurity is beefed up because of the rumors of an impending assassination attempt on the general. \n\nSo - once you\'ve completed your mission, there\'s only one way out. \n\nBlast your way through a wall out into the sewers and return to the subway - we\'ve located the only place where the walls are thin enough - it\'s marked on your map. \n\nKeep it clean, 47!

He has defected to the German Embassy, and will be requesting asylum in Germany. \n\nIt is vital for our client that his suitcase is retrieved - it contains a guidance system the general probably will try and peddle to the highest bidder in the West. \n\nThere is a party tonight at the Embassy, and loads of glitterati and socialites - a perfect cover for your assignment, so wear a tux. \n\nUnfortunately, we couldn\'t provide an invitation. And remember - security is ultra tight, so bringing any sorts of weapon in from the outside is impossible. \n\nThere\'s more. The Russians are furious about the prospect of a former general defecting to a NATO-country. \n\nWe have surveillance recordings of a Spetznaz agent receiving an invitation to this party - check this video to identify this agent. \n\nWe also recorded the General arriving at the embassy. See to it that you get that briefcase, it\'s standard ICA practice, we don\'t want problems with competitors, 47. \n\nI repeat, take out the general and get the suitcase. Good luck, 47.

But his son, Masahiro Hayamoto Jr. and Tanaka Kusahana, a top leader of the Yakuza are having a business meeting at a known location.\n\nIt\'s a pretty remote location, but still with tight security. Your objective is to plant an electronic tracking device in Hayamoto Jr., then eliminate him so his corpse will be brought to Hayamoto Sr.\n\nCheck the map - and watch out for the many yoyimbos guarding the meeting place. 47 - I repeat: Your objectives are to place a transmitter inside Hayamoto Jr. and then eliminate Hayamoto Jr. ',2),(20,'Hidden Valley',7,'47 - this is Diana from Agency.

We\'re quite excited since Hayamoto hasn\'t been registered in public for more than 15 years. \n\nHe emerged at one of his castles in central Japan. This makes it a very tricky assignment. \n\nYou must make your way through some very tough security and bypass a lot of electronic surveillance in order to access the castle undetected. \n\nYou might need to take out the power grids to the alarm units. The whole area is studded with tripwires, guards, substations, alarm units, guard towers, etc. \n\nStrategic planning is extremely important - all their systems are on high alert, so consider your moves there. Your equipment is hidden in a truck just outside the entry gates. \n\nWhen you get the equipment we\'ll brief you on the position of alarm units as well as guard movements. \n\n47 - I repeat: Find the truck with equipment, wait for our briefing, get to the castle undetected, and take out the castle alarm before entering.

This castle, Katsuyama-Jo, is the headquarters of Masahiro Hayamoto.\n\nYour objective is to track down Hayamoto and eliminate him, as well as get away safely with the missile guidance system in his possession.\n\nAlthough this squeaky old fortress may look obsolete, make no mistake - it\'s equipped with all the latest electronic security measures.\n\nOn top of that, the place is crawling with ordinary security guards at lower levels, and Hayamoto\'s own handpicked yoyimbos at the top.\n\nApproach this assignment with the utmost caution, 47 - these people are ruthless, fanatical, and extremely clever.\n\nI repeat, 47 - evade guards and security measures, eliminate Hayamoto and secure the missile guidance system before escaping.',2),(23,'Basement Killing',10,'47 - this is Agency, Diana here. So far no news on Father Vittorio, but we got a neat little mission for you in Malaysia.\n\nIn Kuala Lumpur, you will find the headquarters of a very talented hacker and kleptology expert, Charlie Sidjan - he has managed to steal an extremely valuable piece of software.\n\nIt works as a key signature in military software, and was until recently the exclusive property of the US government.\n\nWith this nifty piece of software in the hands of an adversary, any incoming missile will be detected as American, which renders an otherwise clever missile shield worthless.\n\nOur client wants to retrieve this piece of code and exterminate Charlie Sidjan and all records of this code.\n\nHe is running his business under cover of a company called Carniwarez Inc. Computer Systems. Their network is completely sealed off and inaccessible.\n\nYour objective is to assassinate Charlie Sidjan and place a small dongle on the main server of Carniwarez Inc. Computer System.\n\nThis device will allow outside access to the systems.\n\nThere are guards with intercoms everywhere, closed circuit surveillance of all areas and elevators, metal detectors and reinforced steel doors with electronic locks. Your target is in the 2nd basement.\n\nContinue from there with the direct elevator to Carniwarez main office. You will have to shut down some of the surveillance systems by the elevator.\n\nThe only visual ID we got is the footage of Charlie. It\'s from his 6th birthday. From what we know, you should be able to recognize him from this.\n\nGet your equipment in locker no 137. Find Charlie Sidjan in the basement area. Kill him and access Carniwarez by the direct elevator.',2),(24,'The Graveyard Shift',11,'47 - this is Diana again.

That way our client will be able to access the system and retrieve the encoded information.\n\nThe only way to access the room is by use of the system administrators key card.\n\nOn this floor there are guards patrolling at regular intervals. Some staff will be working late. Hopefully also the system administrator. Check out the map for an outline of this floor.\n\nHappy hacking, 47!',2),(25,'The Jacuzzi Job',12,'47 - Diana here.

So security is tight.\n\n(47) I\'m just outside the penthouse now, looking in - it looks like there is a twin. I will proceed as requested.\n\nThose are the orders. Are you absolutely sure that this is Charlie\'s twin...?\n\n(47) Yes - Definitely looks like him. Although he behaves differently.\n\nAlright.

We require your services once again, and this time you will have to prove your money\'s worth. Our client has lost some cargo, which he wants back at any cost.\n\nIt appears to be stolen by a bunch of renegades, armed to the teeth. The cargo is hidden somewhere in the desert.\n\nThis is a two-stage mission - first you must eliminate Lieutenant Ahmed Zahir and get a map from him. It shows the location of the cargo.\n\nHe\'s quite weak, has a pacemaker and goes for a nap every day after noon prayers, so this is a good time to eliminate him without raising any suspicions. If the alarm is sounded, the mission will fail.\n\nHe is well guarded and behind locked doors, where only his trusted personal bodyguards have keys and access. Both his and the guards\' quarters are situated in front of the palace.\n\nWhen this is done, you will have to kill Colonel Mohammad Amin and steal the key he\'s holding. It\'s an important part of the cargo.\n\nCall me when you\'re done with the lieutenant and I will brief you on the whereabouts of the colonel.\n\nOn the video you can see both targets. It\'s the lieutenant entering the house.\n\nI repeat - eliminate the lieutenant without any alarm, get the map, and call me for further information.',2),(27,'The Motorcade Interception',14,'47 - Your target is a local khan, Abdul Bismillah Malik.

They will arrive from the east along the road.\n\nEliminate him before he reaches his palace - but without harming any of the UN soldiers.

A chopper will pick up the cargo.\n\nLots of soldiers on the base, and patrolling guards on constant high alert - they will react immediately and swiftly, if you are detected.\n\nStealth and surprise is important here, 47 - I repeat: access the base, take out the lieutenant and secure a safe transport of the cargo to the surface.',2),(29,'Temple City Ambush',16,'47 - this is Agency, Diana speaking.\n\nYour mission is to gain access to the sacred cult through a secret passage from behind one of the shops.\n\nOur client was doublecrossed in Afghanistan - that chopper plus cargo was stolen by this cult.

An iconic power couple on the global fashion scene, and two of the most dangerous people in the world.\n\nNovikov and Margolis are in fact the ringleaders of IAGO, an enigmatic spy ring that deals in the global elite\'s most valuable secrets. Unscrupulous and opportunistic, IAGO has caused disastrous security leaks all over the globe.\n\nWhen Crimean separatists caused a deadly meltdown at the Odessa nuclear power plant, IAGO gave them access to the plant\'s security network. And when the Delgado drug cartel shot down the plane of President Hernandez and his family, IAGO provided the classified flight plans.\n\nNow Novikov and Margolis have obtained a NOC list of British undercover agents, which they plan to sell at a secret IAGO auction during the Sanguine show.\n\nSo, our client, MI6, needs us to stop the ringleaders before the NOC list ends up in the wrong hands.\n\nThe Sanguine show will be swarming with security, and Viktor Novikov will be the focus of everyone\'s attention.

A world of armchair assassins killing with impunity.

But early this morning, a band of heavily armed mercenaries freed Strandberg from his prison transport, resulting in the death of several police officers.\n\nStrandberg now takes refuge at his native Swedish Consulate, in front of which crowds of angry protesters have gathered, demanding his handover to Moroccan authorities. We believe that General Zaydan orchestrated Strandberg\'s escape to infuriate the public and spark nationwide riots allowing Zaydan to impose martial law.\n\nOperating out of a field HQ at a nearby abandoned school, he will no doubt use the riots to depict the Rabat government as weak and inept and persuade the General Staff to support a fully fledged military coup in the name of \"National Security\".\n\nOur client, building contractor Hamilton-Lowe, who stand to lose a fortune in government contracts, has hired us to prevent the Coup d\'etat. To do so, you need to paralyze Zaydan\'s rebel forces and prevent the riots from escalating any further, hence the double contract. This is quite the political powder keg, 47, so be careful.
